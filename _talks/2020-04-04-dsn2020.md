Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease which causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 brought a lot of panic to the world. The number of deaths associated with COVID-19 greatly exceeds the other two coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV), and the outbreak is still ongoing, which posed a huge threat to the global public health and economics. This talk focuses on building a conceptualized mathematical model that explains the spread of the virus within a particular number of days with and without government/policy effects.(Policy effects like Shutting down schools, shutting down all religious activities in the country, closing down all borders, restricting interstate traveling and the enforcement of a total lockdown in the most affected locations as well as locations with higher proximity to high risk locations).
