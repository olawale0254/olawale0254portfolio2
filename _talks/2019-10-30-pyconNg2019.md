For more than a decade or so, facial recognition has become a popular area of research in computer vision and one of the most successful applications of image analysis and understanding. Because of the nature of the problem, not only computer science researchers are interested in it, but neuroscientists and psychologists also.
Face detection is an AI-based computer technology that can identify and locate the presence of human faces in digital photos and videos. Face detection algorithm works in such a way that it use algorithms that determine whether images are positive images (i.e. images with a face). While Facial recognition is a biometric software application capable of uniquely identifying or verifying a person by comparing and analyzing patterns based on the person's face. Facial recognition is mostly used for security purposes, though there is increasing interest in other areas of use. In fact, facial recognition technology has received significant attention as it has potential for a wide range of application related to law enforcement as well as other enterprises. This lecture gives a tutorial of a brief introduction to fecial recognition system using python.
