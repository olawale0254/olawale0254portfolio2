I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at Northwestern University (lab of Prof. [Wei Chen](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/chen-wei.html)). I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park (lab of Prof. [Mark Fuge](https://enme.umd.edu/clark/faculty/539/Mark-D-Fuge)), after which I worked as a Research Scientist in Siemens for one and a half years.

My [research](research) explores how artificial intelligence (machine learning in particular) can assist humans in solving engineering design problems. Particularly, I'm interested in developing tools using deep learning, reinforcement learning, active learning, statistical modeling, and engineering optimization to realize performance and efficiency that is unachievable by traditional methods in tasks such as design synthesis, design space exploration, design optimization, and inverse design.
