<div style="text-align: justify">The data consist of about 26 classes of different types of virus images. The purpose of this project was to present a better model which could
outperform models presented by other researchers. To achieve this, we applied Xception transfer learning model for the feature extraction and and our model was trained using LightGBM</div>
